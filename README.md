## [Program Syllabus](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/blob/master/Business%2BAnalytics%2BNanodegree%2BProgram%2BSyllabus%2B2.0.pdf)

## Part 1 - Orientation 
### **[Project 1 - Interpret a Data Visualization](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%201-Interpret%20a%20Data%20Visualization)**

Explore an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights, and write a short report explaining each insight. 
* Analyze the [Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true#2) Tableau dashboard, find three insights in the visualizations.
* For each insight, provide a static image that shares your finding and write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. 


## Part 2 - Introduction to Data
This course covers:
* **Descriptive Statistics**
* **Manipulate, Analyze, and Visualize Data in Excel**
* **Business Metrics, Customer Journey, Marketing and Sales Conversion Funnel**
* **Excel Modeling (Sales and Financial Forecasting Models)**

**WeCart Case Study**

*For the Business Metrics lesson, we use a case study of WeCart, a hypothetical **online App for grocery delivery** (similar to Instacart). WeCart uses a **Subscription Model** where people set up accounts and place orders on a regular basis.*

*WeCart operates in both **B2C** and **B2B** models. They build awareness and try to get their name in front of potential customers by using SEO, email marketing, and ad platforms. They generate sales by reaching out to grocery stores. WeCart gain access to the grocery stores’ customers and the grocery store can access a delivery service.*


### **[Project 2 - Analyze NYSE Data](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%202-Analyze%20NYSE%20Data)**
Use a dataset containing financial performance data from companies listed in NYSE S&P to create an income statement and forecast financial metrics.
* Create data analysis and a presentation to answer business questions. Use summary statistics to derive insights. 
* Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
* Create a financial model that forecasts out metrics for two more years using three scenarios.
* Technologies: Excel Charts, INDEX + MATCH, OFFSET, Data Validation, Functions (MEDIAN, MIN, STDEV, QUARTILE)


## Part 3 - SQL for Data Analysis
*For the examples and practices in this course, we use data from Parch and Posey, a fictitous company sells paper to large companies. By querying the 5 tables in their database **(orders, accounts, regions, sales_reps, web_events)**, we help them answer business questions which are meant to simulate real world problems. This course uses **PostgresSQL** within the classroom. This course covers:*

* **SQL Joins** (joining multiple tables)
* **SQL Aggregations** (DATE Functions, CASE & Aggregations)
* **SQL Subqueries, Temporary Tables, or Common Table Expressions (CTE)**
* **SQL Data Cleaning** (STRPOS & SUBSTR, CONCAT, CAST, COALESCE, LEFT & RIGHT)

:octocat: Takeaway: SQL allows us to analyze more complex questions than Google Analytics. For example, use **Inequality JOINs** to pull all the web traffic events occured before each account's first order to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

### **[Project 3 - Query a Digital Music Store Database](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%203-SQL-Query%20a%20Digital%20Music%20Store%20Database)**
Use a digital music store database to help the company see how they might optimize their business practices
* The Chinook Database contains multiple tables which holds information about a music store, including the media, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 
* Write SQL queries to pull data to answer questions you created. Build visuals to effectively communicate findings. 
* Technologies: SQLite (joins, aggregations, CTEs), Excel charts (clustered bar, pie, etc.), pivot table. 


## Part 4 - Data Visualization 
### **[Project 4 - Story Telling with Data](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%204-Tableau-Data%20Visualization-Telling%20Stories%20with%20Data)**
* Analyze the [US Demographic data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data) containing the census data for all counties in 2015 (from Kaggle). Create 3 visualizations each with a brief description to reveal and convey insights. 
* Technologies: Tableau Public, Tableau Desktop (dashboard, scatter plot, map, box plot, etc.) 
* The links of the visualizations for this project have been accidently deleted. **Please checkout my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pphoebe#!/ ) for more viz I’ve created.**
