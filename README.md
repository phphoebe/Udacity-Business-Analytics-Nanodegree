* Excel
* SQL
* Tableau

## Analyzing Data for any industry – Making better, data-informed decisions

* **Descriptive Statistics**: data types, measures of center, spread, shape, and outliers associated with quantitative data. Statistical and mathematical notations. 
* **Business Metrics** across a range of business functions (marketing, sales, finance, growth, engagement). Calculate and interpret KPIs, including CTR, CPC, CPA, CAC, CLTV, Churn Rate, Stickiness. 
* **Excel Modeling**: advanced lookup (index, match, offset) and data validation tools in MS Excel and Google Sheet. Financial and Sales forecasting models. Exposure to Software as a service (SaaS) and Subscribed based service model. 
* **Relational Database (RDS)** knowledge, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and advanced SQL querying. This course uses PostgresSQL within the classroom. 
* **Data Visualization**: best design practices, use the most appropriate chart for a particular situation, make dashboards & stories in Tableau. 

This program is in collaboration with:

## [Program Syllabus](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/blob/master/Business%2BAnalytics%2BNanodegree%2BProgram%2BSyllabus%2B2.0.pdf)

## Part 1 - Orientation 
### **[Project 1 - Interpret a Data Visualization](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%201-Interpret%20a%20Data%20Visualization)**

Explore an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights, and write a short report explaining each insight. 
* Analyze the [Malaria in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/views/MakeoverMonday34Malaria_0/MalariainAfrica?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no&:display_count=y&:display_static_image=y&:bootstrapWhenNotified=true#2) Tableau dashboard, find three insights in the visualizations.
* For each insight, provide a static image that shares your finding and write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. 


## Part 2 - Introduction to Data
### **[Project 2 - Analyze NYSE Data](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%202-Analyze%20NYSE%20Data)**
Use a dataset containing financial performance data from companies listed in NYSE S&P to create an income statement and forecast financial metrics.
* Create data analysis and a presentation to answer business questions. Use summary statistics to derive insights. 
* Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
* Create a financial model that forecasts out metrics for two more years using three scenarios.
* Technologies: Excel Charts, INDEX + MATCH, OFFSET, Data Validation, Functions (MEDIAN, MIN, STDEV, QUARTILE, etc.)


## Part 3 - SQL for Data Analysis
*For the examples and practices in this course, we use data from Parch and Posey, a fictitous company sells paper to large companies. By querying the 5 tables in their database (orders, accounts, regions, sales_reps, web_events), we them answer business questions which are meant to simulate real world problems.*

This course cover:
* SQL Joins
* SQL Aggregations (DATE Functions, CASE & Aggregations)
* SQL Subqueries, Temporary Tables, or Common Table Expressions (CTE)
* SQL Data Cleaning (STRPOS & SUBSTR, CONCAT, CAST, COALESCE, LEFT & RIGHT)

Takeaway: SQL allows us to analyze more complex questions than Google Analytics. For example, use *Inequality JOINs* to pull all the web traffic events occured before each account's first order to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

### **[Project 3 - Query a Digital Music Store Database](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%203-SQL-Query%20a%20Digital%20Music%20Store%20Database)**
Use a digital music store database to help the company see how they might optimize their business practices
* The Chinook Database contains multiple tables which holds information about a music store, including the media, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 
* Write SQL queries to pull data to answer questions you created. Build visuals to effectively communicate findings. 
* Technologies: SQLite (joins, aggregations, CTEs), Excel charts (clustered bar, pie, etc.), pivot table. 

## Part 4 - Data Visualization 
### **[Project 4 - Story Telling with Data](https://github.com/phphoebe/udacity-band-projects/tree/master/Project%204-Tableau-Data%20Visualization-Telling%20Stories%20with%20Data)**
* Analyze the [US Demographic data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data) containing the census data for all counties in 2015 (from Kaggle). Create 3 visualizations each with a brief description to reveal and convey insights. 
* Technologies: Tableau Public, Tableau Desktop (dashboard, scatter plot, map, box plot, etc.) 
* The links of the visualizations for this project have been accidently deleted. Please checkout my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pphoebe#!/ ) for more viz I’ve created.
